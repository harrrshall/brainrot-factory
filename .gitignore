# ===================================================================
# Python Virtual Environments
#
# Reason: These folders contain thousands of files specific to your
# machine's setup and can be massive. They should never be in version
# control. Others should install dependencies from requirements.txt.
# ===================================================================
myenv/
video_env/
chatterbox/chatterbox-venv/
/env/
/.venv/
/venv/


# ===================================================================
# Python Cache & System Files
#
# Reason: These are auto-generated cache and system-specific files
# that clutter the repository and can cause conflicts.
# ===================================================================
__pycache__/
*.py[cod]
*$py.class
*.so
.DS_Store
.DS_Store?
.pytest_cache/


# ===================================================================
# Generated Outputs & Media
#
# Reason: Git is not designed for large binary files like audio and
# video. Tracking them will quickly bloat the repository size, making

# cloning and pulling very slow. These files should be regenerated by
# running the pipeline scripts.
# ===================================================================
# Audio and Video Pipeline Outputs
chatterbox/audio_production/
final_videos/
final_videos_ffmpeg/

# Data and Screenshot Outputs
twitter_analysis/data/
twitter_analysis/screenshots/
twitter_analysis/narrations/

# Temporary ffmpeg files
temp-audio.m4a


# ===================================================================
# Logs and Reports
#
# Reason: Log files and reports change with every run and are specific
# to a single execution. They provide no long-term value to the
# project's source code history.
# ===================================================================
*.log
logs/
chatterbox/audio_production/reports/
twitter_analysis/reports/
twitter_analysis/logs/
/report/
/reports/


# ===================================================================
# Large Assets & Models
#
# Reason: Like generated media, large asset files (over a few MB)
# should not be tracked directly. Use a service like Git LFS or
# instruct users to download them separately.
# ===================================================================
video_assets/background_gameplay.mp4
chatterbox/peter.mp3
# Note: You might want to track the avatar image if it's small.
# If you want to track it, remove the line below.
video_assets/peter_avatar.png


# ===================================================================
# Input Data Files
#
# Reason: Raw data files can be large and are often transient.
# It's better to describe how to get them than to store them.
# ===================================================================
*.csv
*.json
# If you want to keep an *example* input file, you can "un-ignore" it.
# For example, to keep 'example_narrations.json' but ignore all others:
# !example_narrations.json


# ===================================================================
# IDE and Editor-specific files
#
# Reason: These are specific to your personal development environment
# and should not be shared.
# ===================================================================
.idea/
.vscode/
*.swp
*.swo


# ===================================================================
# Node.js (if used for scraping)
